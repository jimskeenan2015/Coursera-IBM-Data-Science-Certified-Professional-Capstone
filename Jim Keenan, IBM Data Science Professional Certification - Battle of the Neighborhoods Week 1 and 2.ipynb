    "As a Data Scientist, I would like to make use of the methods and tools we have studied to compare the similarities and dissimilarities of New York City, New York, and Toronto, Canada, which will then be compared to a new City, London, England. The reason for doing this is many people from the United Kingdom, including myself, move from Europe to The United States of America, and it would be useful to have a meaningful scientific study to show similarities and dissimilarities between the places they are moving from, in this case London, England, to either New York City, New York, or Toronto, Canada. \n",
    "In that all three cities are the financial and cultural capitals of their respective countries, this information should prove useful, the similarities being a good recommendation factor for people who would like to move to North America ( USA and Canada ), but would like somewhere similar to where they had come from ( London ). Equally, there are some immigrants who may like to move to somewhere entirely different – the dissimilarities. \n"

The Venue Category and lat/longs will then be used as features with quantitative measures to establish a model.\n",
    "The Data will be grouped by venue type and count, by Borough, for all three cities. A key will be assigned for each city, NY, TC and LE  and data merged to allow comparative studies on the summary data.\n",
    "Based on the data for all three cities, a common Python program will be created to compare the summary information grouped by venue type and quantity by City.\n",
    "A Python dataframe will be created for each city, which will find the 10 most popular venue categories by quantity and ranked  for each neighborhood by city.\n",
    "Using the 3 common dataframes, using K-Means Clustering to look at inter-clustering distances, with an arbitrary K value of 5, that is, 5 clusters. Since K-Means relies on non-categorical data, all data will be normalized into numeric values. (contd. On next page)\n",
